And if you are new to Screwdriver, we suggest you start by reading through the Domain model and YAML configuration to get an idea of different concepts in Screwdriver and how they tie together. To see some working examples, you can try out our quickstart examples with different languages to choose from.

Adding a new sentece here and there.

Yahoo's open-source project [Screwdriver](http://screwdriver.cd/), a Continuous Delivery Build System for Dynamic Infrastructure, was just [released](https://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/155765242061/open-sourcing-screwdriver-yahoos-continuous) with all product [docs available in English and Japanese](http://docs.screwdriver.cd).

Developers can benefit from Continuous Delivery, adapting to users’ needs quicker, while reducing the inherent friction associated with releasing software changes.  Improving product quality and engineering agility throuhout the whole development cycle from commit to production, Yahoo greatly boosted the ability to deliver products, providing nothing less but full automation.

This community-driven tool will simplify deployment pipelines, optimize for trunk development, and make rolling back easier. Screwdriver handles over 25,000+ builds per day and 12,000+ daily git commits as a single shared entrypoint for Yahoo. It supports multiple languages and handles both virtual machine and container-based builds and deployment. 

For more details read the official announcement within the [blog written by Yahoo's Sr. Director James Collins Principal Engineer St. John Johnson](https://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/155765242061/open-sourcing-screwdriver-yahoos-continuous).

While Yahoo has been filling the headlines with drastic strategic decisions lately, we are very proud to support Yahoo's open-source project and take the collaborative results to new places in the world.

Thanks to a supportive community and its collaborative translation integrated with Locki, Screwdriver docs are now available to developers in Japanese as well. We have worked with Screwdriver's local team in Tokyo on making the latest Continuous Delivery solutions available to Japanese developers in their native language, instantly.

### We wish Screwdriver.cd continuous success, with continuous and additional language support!

Test paragraph here

You could present in the order provided. Or you may find a different order works for you and your audience. After presenting a couple of times to individual business units within your organization, you will work out how best to approach it. The idea here is to give you a set of templates so that you are not having to start from a blank canvas.

In the first of four lectures on How to Build a Product, Michael Seibel, CEO of Y Combinator, interviews Steve Huffman and Emmett Shear on how they built their products as founder-CEO's of Reddit and Twitch, respectively.

Yuri Sagalov, CEO of Amium, and Sam Altman hold Live Office Hours with three startups: MoonlightWork, Canny and Tuml. They'll discuss their ideas and their thought processes around building their companies.

In today's lecture, we're joined by Stewart Butterfield, founder and CEO of Slack, and Adam D'Angelo, founder and CEO of Quora. Sam and Stewart will explore the process of getting an idea, followed by Adam on tracking metrics for your company.

GitLocalize is a continuous localization platform for GitHub repositories and automates the process for developers. Because of the ever-changing nature of Internet-related product, keeping localizing them has been really challenging. GitLocalize solves this by connecting to your GitHub repository and naturally integrating with your development workflow in just a few clicks.

We started supporting from Markdown files. Try GitLocalize in a minute if you have a documentation project that you want to localize.

Once you integrate your repo with GitLocalize, it starts pulling all the localization related files into its platform and watching the changes.

With GitLocalize, your team no longer need to do anything extra to localize your project and developers only need to look at those pull request coming.

Since it automatically links a translation with its original sentence, it can show you which part needs to be translated when the original one is updated.
